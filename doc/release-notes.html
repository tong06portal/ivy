<h2>Announcement</h2>

<pre>
March 23, 2014 - The Ivy project is pleased to announce its 2.4.0-RC1 release.

Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and
reporting) project dependencies, characterized by flexibility,
configurability, and tight integration with Apache Ant.

Key features of this 2.4.0-RC1 release are
* some new Ant tasks
* improved OSGI support
* numerous bug fixes as documented in Jira and in the release notes

As a release candidate version, we strongly encourage the use of this version for 
testing and validation. From now on, features are frozen until final 2.4.0 version, 
only bug fixes will be applied before 2.4.0. If no outstanding bugs are reported 
with this release candidate, it will promoted to 2.4.0 about three weeks after this
release candidate. 

Issues should be reported to:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY

<h3>1. What is Apache Ivy?</h3>

Apache Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. 
It is characterized by the following:

   1. flexibility and configurability 
        Apache Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is not tied to any 
        methodology or structure. 
        Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability 
        to be adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build 
        processes.
   2. tight integration with Apache Ant
        while available as a standalone tool, Apache Ivy works particularly well 
        with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful Ant tasks ranging 
        from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and publication.

<h3>2. How to Get Involved</h3>

The Apache Ivy project really needs and appreciates any contributions, 
including documentation help, source code and feedback.  If you are interested
in contributing, please visit http://ant.apache.org/ivy/get-involved.html.

<h3>3. How to Report Issues</h3>

The Apache Ivy project uses JIRA for issue tracking.  Please report any 
issues you find at http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVY
